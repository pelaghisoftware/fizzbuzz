## Overview
1. Add link to the live demo.
2. Used Springboot to create a simple Rest API while exploring the use of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern.
3. In this project, I improved on the following.
    - Modern Spring Boot annotations, patterns, and testing.
    - Using newer Java features such as records.
    - Implementing a usable Chain of Responsibility Pattern.
4. Some simple tips:
    - Use a Chain of Responsiblity pattern when you have a lengthy if/if else/else or when there is a set of steps that must happen in order to allow for easy addition and removal.
    - Use dependency injection through the constructors instead of field injection. This allows your code to require less changes if you want to move away from Spring.
<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot of the live project.
    1. Link to a 'live demo.'
    2. Describe your overall experience in a couple of sentences.
    3. List a few specific technical things that you learned or improved on.
    4. Share any other tips or guidance for others attempting this or something similar.
