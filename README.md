## Overview
1. Add link to the live demo.
   - To use: [http://site:8080]
2. Used Springboot to create a simple Rest API while exploring the use of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern.
3. In this project, I improved on the following.
    - Modern Spring Boot annotations, patterns, and testing.
    - Using newer Java features such as records.
    - Implementing a usable Chain of Responsibility Pattern.
4. Some simple tips:
    - Use a Chain of Responsiblity pattern when you have a lengthy if/if else/else or when there is a set of steps that must happen in order to allow for easy addition and removal.
    - Use dependency injection through the constructors instead of field injection. This allows your code to require less changes if you want to move away from Spring.

## Built With

## Features

This project serves as a simple example of how to structure a SpringBoot project and how to use an extremely useful pattern.
